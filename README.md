## **My DevOps learning and lab notes**
I was lucky to get a KodeKloud subscription for one year.Now I have left 8 months.
I learn and practice in that platform and take notes, write commands and concepts , even my ideas I write.then I use Genarative Pre-training Transformer Ai models to structure them and put Them here for refer whenever I want to.
